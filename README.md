# dhproject

I downloaded the material from http://metashare.csc.fi/repository/browse/yle-news-archive-easy-to-read-finnish-2011-2018-source/490ea746727111e9b99d005056be118e6ce5a99c8b2443cdb736a238461dd0ae/ and turned it into .txt files. Then I manipulated the raw text and the result is attached as different versions of the original text. The whole procedure can be found in DHproject Bozovic.
